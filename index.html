      			<p>My previous work involves conducting surveys and experiments. Though it uses a different vocabulary, many of the concerns of conducting online studies also involve UX principles. I've highlighted these aspects of my past projects below.</p>
      			<dl class="accordion" data-accordion> 
      			<dd> 
      			<a href="#panel1" class="work">Master's Thesis survey design</a> 
      			<div id="panel1" class="content">
      			<p class="restitle">Master's thesis survey design</p>

      			<p>For my master's thesis, I conducted an online experiment to examine how the racial ideology of news articles would affect how people would discuss the Trayvon Martin shooting. When designing this survey, my focus was to make sure respondents' experience with the survey yielded the data I needed for my analyses. Based on my past research experience and best practices, I decided that my main goals should be:</p>
      			<ul>
      			<li>To make sure the wording of the survey was as clear as possible.</li>
            <li>To have the format be fairly plain so that it would have as little effect on responses as possible.</li>
      			<li>To split up number of questions per page as to not overwhelm respondents while still not making the survey too long.</li>
      			<li>To make sure it could be taken on mobile devices as well as desktop devices.</li>
      			</ul>

      			<p>In order to check the wording of the questions and instructions, I gave a paper version of the survey draft to a small number of people, and asked them questions as they went along the survey (a technique called cognitive testing). I asked questions such as "How would you explain these instructions in your own words?" and "What do you think this question is asking?" Based on their answers and suggestions, I tweaked the wording to make everything as clear as possible.</p>

      			<p>I also didn't want the look of the survey to bias participants. I would show them example articles on teh Trayvon Martin shooting. I wanted the content to have an effect, but not the publication, layout, advertisements, etc. I therefore decided to only use the text of the articles to control for this. There was a risk that this would hurt the credibility of the articles. However, during cognitive testing, I found that I was able to get the effect I wanted; respondents' focus was on the content, and the articles were seen as credible despite the lack of familiar formatting.</p>

      			<p>I had a fairly large number of questions to ask, and one main concern I had was survey length. The key was a balance between having the survey be quick enough to not take too long due to too many pages, and not making it so easy to breeze through that respondents wouldn't pay attention and properly focus on each question. Based on previous research, I kept the questions to a maximum of 5 questions per page.</p>

      			<p> In order to make sure that the survey could also be taken on mobile devices, I used a feature of SurveyGizmo that also allowed for mobile templates.</p>

      			<p> After all of this research and planning, the survey eventually looked like this:</p>
      			<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-4" data-clearing>
      			<li><a href="thesis1.png"><img src="thesis1.png" /></a></li>
      			<li><a href="thesis2.png"><img src="thesis2.png" /></a></li>
      			<li><a href="thesis3.png"><img src="thesis3.png" /></a></li>
      			</ul>
      			<p>While these particular design constraints and practices are unique to research, I was able to take steps to achieve my main goal of getting a large amount of quality responses. I was able to get 300+ of these responses while keeping the survey length to 7 minutes for 30+ questions, and with no abandonded surveys.</p>

      			<p class="restitle">Business school survey pretesting</p>
      			<p>
      			I have worked on stages of this project for my current employer over the last 2-3 years. The client is a business school, and the project involves a series of surveys given to the school's alumni and other business leaders on the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and education.</p>
      			<p> For past surveys, pretesting was done in order to ensure the quality of the content and design of the online survey. Our research team's thought process for pre-testing included:</p>
      			<ul>
      			<li>Making sure the wording was clear.</li>
      			<li>Ensuring that the questions asked were received positively and didn't offend participants.</li>
      			<li>Finding any errors, repititions, or contradictions, in any concepts mentioned in the survey.</li>
      			<li>Correcting technical errors in the survey programming, especially those that would deter completion.</li>
      			</ul>

      			<p>My role in the process was to aid with managing the survey development and programming. This included:</p>
      			<ul>
      			<li>Assisting with the design of the survey, including adding elements at the client's request, and ensuring that the color scheme matched the client's branding.</li>
      			<li>Conducting cognitive interviews in order collect information on how respondents understood the survey content. After conducting these interviews, I presented my findings to the client and made suggestions on changes to survey content, layout, and possible challenges.</li>
            <li>Taking this information, and having dicussions with the client in order to make sure that they received the data needed for their analyses while making sure that the display and wording is as clear to the respondents as possible.</li>
      			<li>Planning and executing the testing of the survey programming. I took the survey several times, logged any errors, and worked through issues with the programming team.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In order to best advise the client, when I interview respondents I evaluated:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Participants' interest in the topic</li>
            <li>Their understanding of key terms, question wording</li>
            <li>Reaction to answer options</li>
            <li>Overall interest in teh survey</li>
            <li>Feedback on what could be included or excluded</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I did this by going through a draft of the survey with 6 to 10 selected respondents, and asking followup questions throughout the interview on each item. I also asked participants to think aloud, and note questions they ask me and any impressions about specific questions. I then compared this to the client's expentations and data needs.</p>

           <div class="content" id="me">

            <p>While I dabbled in a bit of software QA after college, I didn't hear about UX until a friend told me about it while I was in graduate school. Once I did more research about the field, I was hooked, and my interest in UX and web design/development has kept growing ever since.  After years of working in social science research, I'm now pursuing a career as a UX designer and researcher. While my career path is changing, my ultimate career goal has always been to do work that has a positive impact on others.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not studying UX and learning how to code, I'm reading, writing stories, and watching Cosmos.</p>

            <p>I've always been interested in  understanding the complex relationship between media and individuals/society. While I lack specific UX experience, I understand the importance of UX in conducting research. A lot of my current work involves similar principles to UX design. People won't participate in research that's not easy and intuitive. Part of my current work involves making sure that the experience of taking a client's online survey is as smooth as possible. </p>

            <p> I'm located in the Boston area, and currently looking for opportunities to get started working in UX. If there's a UX meetup happening in Boston, I am very likely there.</p>
